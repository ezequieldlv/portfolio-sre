Here is a collection of my work in **Infrastructure**, **Software Development**, and **Automation**.

## 🚀 Home Lab & Private Cloud (In Progress)
*Infrastructure as Code / Self-Hosting*

Building a dedicated homelab on a **Raspberry Pi 5** to simulate a production environment.
* **Goal:** Host services (DNS, VPN, Media) avoiding cloud costs and gaining low-level control.
* **Stack:** Docker, Pi-hole (DNS Filtering), WireGuard VPN, Nginx Proxy Manager.
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5.

## 📄 Internal Knowledge Base Modernization
*Docs-as-Code / Automation (at Konecta)*

Led the migration of technical documentation from legacy Google Sites to a modern workflow.
* **Impact:** Improved information retrieval speed for Tier 2 agents.
* **Result:** Standardized troubleshooting guides facilitating collaborative maintenance.
**The Challenge:** Information was scattered across legacy sites.
**The Solution:** Migrated to a Docs-as-Code workflow.

> **Tech Stack:** `MkDocs` `Python` `GitLab` `Markdown`

## 📦 Logistics Microservices Backend
*Java / Microservices (University Project)*

Co-developed a backend solution for a terrestrial logistics system (shipping containers).
* **Architecture:** Microservices-based architecture ensuring modularity.
* **Tech:** **Java Spring Boot**, **Docker**, Keycloak (Identity Management), RESTful APIs.

## 🌐 SRE Portfolio (This Website)
*Web Performance / CI/CD*

A minimalist, high-performance portfolio built with a **Docs-as-Code** philosophy.
* **Engine:** Hugo (Static Site Generator) + PaperMod Theme.
* **Deployment:** Dockerized container served via Nginx (Upcoming).

## 🧬 Biohacking Data Analysis (Planned)
*Python / Data Observability*

Scripts to correlate physiological data (sleep, nutrition) with cognitive performance, applying observability principles to human biology.
