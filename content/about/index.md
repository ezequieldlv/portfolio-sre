## 👨‍💻 Profile

I am a **Systems Engineering student** at UTN FRC and an aspiring **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**.

My journey began in **Tier 2 Technical Support**, handling critical ISP-level incidents. This experience gave me a unique perspective on reliability: I don't just build systems; I understand how they fail under pressure and how to troubleshoot them efficiently.

Currently, I am executing a rigorous **9-Phase Engineering Roadmap** to transition from "Localhost" to "Cloud Native Architect". I am passionate about **Infrastructure as Code**, **Linux Hardening** (Arch is my daily driver), and applying **Biohacking principles** to optimize cognitive performance.
